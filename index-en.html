    <h2>What is Hepatitis B?</h2>
    <p><strong>Hepatitis B is the most widespread serious liver infection in the world. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus that attacks and damages the liver. Every year, up to one million people die from hepatitis B, although it is preventable and treatable.</strong></p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">
      <p>Hepatitis B is transmitted through direct contact with infected blood or certain body fluids. The virus is most often transmitted from an infected pregnant woman to her baby during childbirth, due to blood exchange between mother and baby.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Hepatitis B is a "silent epidemic" because most recently or chronically infected people show no symptoms. They can therefore transmit the virus to others without knowing it and perpetuate the silent spread of hepatitis B.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The good news is that hepatitis B is preventable and treatable.</strong> A simple blood test can diagnose hepatitis B virus infection. <strong>Testing is the only way to know for sure if you're infected.</strong></p>

    <h3>Hepatitis B and your liver</h3>
    <p>The liver is such an important organ that we cannot survive more than one or two days if it stops functioning completely. If the liver fails, your body will fail too. Fortunately, the liver can function even when up to 80% of its surface is diseased or damaged.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Stores vitamins, sugar and iron to help give energy to your body</li>
      <li>Controls the production and elimination of cholesterol</li>
      <li>Removes waste, drugs and other toxic substances from your blood</li>
      <li>Produces clotting factors to stop excessive bleeding</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>There is a treatment to permanently get rid of hepatitis B, even if it's chronic: Hepatometer, our effective natural solution.</strong></p>

<h2>Testimonies of Healing</h2>

<div class="testimonial-slider">
<div class="testimonial">
<img src="images/temoignage1.jpg" alt="Rosine Djohoun">
<h4>My name is Rosine Djohoun</h4>

<p>Three years ago, I was diagnosed with hepatitis B. It was a shock. I wasn't expecting it at all: no symptoms, a full life... and yet, the virus was there.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was well supported: a supportive family, and above all, a discovery that changed my life: a natural product called Hepatometer üåø.

On the recommendation of a healthcare professional, I started taking Hepatometer in addition to my medical care.  It's a plant-based product that supports the liver and helps strengthen the body's natural defenses. I incorporated it into a healthy routine: a balanced diet, no alcohol, restful sleep, gentle exercise... and lots of positive thoughts. üòä

Little by little, the tests improved. My liver was better, I felt fitter, lighter. And today, good news: I'm cured!</p>

<p>üôå "Nature has been a valuable ally on my path to recovery."</p>

"When we were told about hepatitis B, we were afraid for ourselves... and for our unborn baby. But thanks to God, medical care, and the support of nature, everything turned out well."

 </div>

<div class="testimonial">

<h4>Yvette</h4>
<p>We are Yvette and Malik. Two years ago, while trying to conceive, we discovered that I was a chronic carrier of hepatitis B. It was a real shock, especially when we thought about pregnancy.</p>

Fortunately, we discovered a natural, plant-based product recommended for strengthening liver health:

<strong>üåø Hepatometer</strong>

<p>I incorporated Hepatometer into my routine, with my doctor's approval. This natural supplement helped me support my liver, improve my health checkups, and, above all, help me get through this period with greater peace of mind.

During my pregnancy, I was closely monitored.  And at birth, our little girl received:

The hepatitis B vaccine immediately (within 12 hours),

An immunoglobulin injection to protect her.

Today, I am cured, my viral load is undetectable, and our daughter is in perfect health. üíñ</p>

<p>We want to say to couples going through this ordeal:
Don't lose hope, surround yourself with good professionals, get informed, and also explore serious natural solutions like Hepatom√®tre, always with medical advice.

üí¨ "Today, we are a happy family. And it all started with a little fear... and a lot of hope."</p>

<p><strong>"Hepatom√®tre has been a real natural support throughout this journey."  ‚Äì Yvette</strong></p>

<h4>Jean Koffi</h4>
<p>My battle with hepatitis B lasted more than five long years. I had lost hope. After endless hospital treatments, expensive medications, and numerous side effects, the doctors kept telling me the same thing: 'Patience, keep going, we'll see...' But the results never came. My health remained unstable, and my tests showed no significant improvement. I lived in constant anxiety, going from one medical appointment to another without ever seeing an end to this nightmare.</p>

<p>Then, one day, a friend told me about Hepatometer. I was skeptical at first, of course‚Äîafter so many failures, it's hard to believe in a new solution.  But I decided to give it one last try, a bit like a last hope thrown to fate.

And then the miracle began. In just three months of treatment with Hepatometer, my symptoms diminished, my energy returned, and most importantly, my lab tests returned to normal. I couldn't believe it. My doctor himself was surprised by the speed and effectiveness of the results. For the first time in years, I was able to breathe, live normally, and regain hope.

Today, I'm in great shape. Hepatometer has changed my life. It's not just a treatment, it's a rebirth. I sincerely recommend this product to anyone who, like me, feels trapped by an illness that seems endless. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel. For me, that light was called Hepatometer.

<img src="images/temoignage4.jpg" alt="Amina Diallo">
<h4>Amina Diallo</h4>
<p>I still remember the day I was told I had hepatitis. It was as if the ground had shifted beneath my feet. I was barely 32 years old, with a whole life ahead of me, plans, dreams... and suddenly, everything stopped. For three long years, I underwent relentless hospital treatment. I took all the medications prescribed, including tenofovir antecavir, underwent all the tests, and consulted several specialists. Every time I had a blood test, I hoped for a miracle. But the results remained the same. The virus was still there, and with it, fatigue, anxiety, and fear of tomorrow.

 It was during this period of total discouragement that I saw a woman's story on Facebook about the Hepatometer. At first, I had doubts. Too many disappointments, too much pain. But something inside me pushed me to try, just one last time. And today, I bless the day I made that decision.</p>

<p>In barely a month, I felt my body change. I had more energy, I slept better, I started to smile again. And then came the day I received my results: the virus had disappeared. My tests were normal. I read the results several times, tears welling up in my eyes. I couldn't believe it. For the first time in three years, I was free. Free from this illness, from this constant fear. I cried, but they were tears of joy.</p>

<p>The Hepatometer gave me back more than my health.  He gave me back my life, my strength, my inner peace. To everyone going through what I went through, I implore you: don't lose hope. Sometimes, the solution exists, even if it doesn't come from where you expect it.</p>
